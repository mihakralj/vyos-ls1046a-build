# Flavor: `ask` — ASK 2.0 (clean-room rewrite)

**Status:** scaffold only. Implementation tracked in
[`specs/ask-2.0-rewrite-spec.md`](../../../specs/ask-2.0-rewrite-spec.md)
(v0.6, 2026-05-11).

This flavor is the **clean-room rewrite** of the NXP ASK fast-path for
LS1046A. It supersedes the legacy ASK 1.x stack (proprietary `cdx.ko`,
`auto_bridge.ko`, `cmm`, `dpa_app`, the 5797-line in-tree-hooks patch,
and the 266-file vendored NXP SDK FMan/QMan/BMan driver overlay) in
**entirety**. Everything ASK 1.x was deleted from this branch
(`ask20`) on 2026-05-12.

The brand "ASK" and the `FLAVOR=ask` build target carry forward
unchanged. The 210-series FMan microcode (loaded by U-Boot from SPI
flash on every shipped Mono Gateway) is also unchanged — ASK 2.0 sits
on top of it without touching the binary.

## ABI and config compatibility with ASK 1.x

Per spec §18, the following operator-facing surfaces are kept stable so
existing field configs, vendor tools, and the hardware microcode still
boot unchanged:

- `/etc/cdx_cfg.xml`, `/etc/cdx_pcd.xml`, `/etc/cdx_sp.xml` — same
  schemas, ingested by `ask-load` instead of `dpa_app`.
- `/dev/cdx_ctrl` — symlink to the new `/dev/ask_ctrl` chardev; the
  legacy ioctl numbers and structs work via a compat shim in
  `oot-modules/ask/ask_dev.c`.
- `libfci.so.1` SONAME — symlinked to `libask_fci.so.1`, which wraps
  the new generic-netlink protocol.
- `/etc/config/fastforward` — same ALG-exclusion list format,
  consumed by `askd`.

## What stays from the legacy stack

Nothing in source form. The only carryovers are the operator-visible
schemas and ABI surfaces above, plus the `xt_QOSMARK` and `xt_QOSCONNMARK`
match modules (verbatim copy into `200-ask2-hooks.patch` per spec §10.1).

## Implementation order
