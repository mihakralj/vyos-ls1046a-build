 *
 * struct ask_hw_pcd holds the per-FMan PCD handles that ask.ko owns
 * for the lifetime of the module: the PCD subsystem handle resolved
 * from DT, a single CC tree (group-count = 1), the per-proto CC nodes
 * that the dispatch layer (PR14g-body-2) populates with exact-match
 * 5-tuple keys, and the upstream KG scheme that chains the
 * silicon's KeyGen hash output into the CC tree's group table.
 *
 * Body-1 brings up exactly one CC node (v4-TCP).  IPv4 UDP, IPv6 TCP,
 * IPv6 UDP land as additional struct fields + bring-up calls in later
 * sub-PRs (M3.x).  The struct is forward-declared opaquely in
 * ask_internal.h scope - the full definition lives in ask_hw.c so
 * other TUs cannot inadvertently grow new dependencies on the PCD
 * handle layout.
 *
 * NULL-safe: if DT resolution or PCD probe fails (no fsl,fman node,
 * fman driver not bound, MURAM exhaustion), ask_hw_pcd_bringup()
 * logs a single warn and returns 0.  ask_hw_pcd_get() then returns
 * NULL and the body-2 dispatcher falls back to software-only mode
 * (existing fake_hw_id_seq atomic in ask_flow.c).  This keeps ask.ko
 * loadable on non-DPAA hosts and on DPAA hosts where the PCD chain
 * has been disabled for diagnostics.
 *
 * Per Q1/Q2/Q3 architectural decisions (approved 2026-05-14):
 *   - hw_flow_id encodes (node_token : 16) | (key_idx : 16) so the
 *     dispatcher can route OP_FLOW_REMOVE / OP_FLOW_QUERY_STATS back
 *     to the right CC node without a side-table lookup.
 *   - node_token is a per-ask_hw_pcd small-integer ID assigned at
 *     bring-up.  Body-1 uses token 1 for v4-TCP; higher numbers are
 *     reserved for the remaining flow types.  Token 0 is a sentinel
