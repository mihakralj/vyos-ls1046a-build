# ASK2 source tree — `kernel/ask/`

**Status:** shipping. `ask.ko` is built into **every** image and reaches
10.259 Gbps line rate at 0.16% CPU on silicon. Execution plan:
[`plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md`](../../plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md).
Architecture index:
[`specs/ask2-rewrite-spec.md`](../../specs/ask2-rewrite-spec.md).
State machine + CLI contract:
[`plans/DUAL-DATAPLANE.md`](../../plans/DUAL-DATAPLANE.md).

This directory is the **modern rewrite** of the NXP ASK fast-path for
LS1046A. It supersedes the legacy ASK 1.x stack (proprietary `cdx.ko`,
`auto_bridge.ko`, `cmm`, `dpa_app`, the 5797-line in-tree-hooks patch,
and the 266-file vendored NXP SDK FMan/QMan/BMan driver overlay) in
**entirety**. Everything ASK 1.x was deleted on 2026-05-12.

ASK2 is **not a build variant**. The `default|ask|vpp` flavor split was
retired 2026-06-14 and the `FLAVOR` variable removed 2026-07-26; this tree
moved from `kernel/flavors/ask/` to `kernel/ask/` at the same time. `ask.ko`
ships in every image, dormant until
`set interfaces ethernet eth<n> offload ask` engages it per-interface at
runtime. The 210-series FMan microcode (loaded by U-Boot from SPI flash on
every shipped Mono Gateway) is unchanged — ASK2 sits on top of it without
touching the binary.

```

The in-tree kernel side of ASK2 is **not** here — it lives in
[`kernel/common/patches/board/`](../common/patches/board/) (the FMan PCD
subsystem, KeyGen, CC, MANIP, Policer, FE-VM ehash: patches 0092–0164) plus
the `bin/kernel-fixups/F_*.py` source fixups.

## No userspace daemon

Earlier revisions of this document described `askd`, `ask-load`, and
`libask_fci` replacing `cmm`, `dpa_app`, and `libfci`, along with
`/dev/cdx_ctrl` and `/etc/cdx_*.xml` ABI-compat shims. **None of that was
built and none of it is planned.** ASK2's control plane is the kernel module
plus the VyOS CLI: configuration through
`set interfaces ethernet eth<n> offload ask`, observability through
`show interfaces ethernet eth<n> offload ask flows` (a thin `ynl` wrapper).
The `userspace/askd/` directory is a leftover placeholder.

## KUnit debug builds (T-M8-5, 2026-08-28)

Dispatch the self-hosted build with input `kunit=true`. The build then:

- merges `kernel-config/90-kunit.config` into the kernel defconfig and
  force-sets `CONFIG_KUNIT=y`, `KUNIT_DEBUGFS`, `FSL_FMAN_PCD_KUNIT_TEST`,
  `PROVE_RCU`, `PROVE_LOCKING` after the VyOS fragment merge
  (`bin/ci-setup-kernel.sh`), so the built-in FMan PCD suites run at boot
  and print KTAP on the serial console;
- compiles the OOT harness `ask_kunit.ko`
  (`CONFIG_NET_ASK_KUNIT_TEST=m` in `ci-build.sh`) and ships it in the
  ask-modules package.

On the board: install the KUnit ISO, boot (KTAP from the built-in FMan
suites lands in dmesg), then `sudo modprobe ask && sudo modprobe ask_kunit`
to run every ASK suite under PROVE_RCU/PROVE_LOCKING; results land in
dmesg and `/sys/kernel/debug/kunit/`. `ask.ko` must load first: the suites
drive its live tables through the exported API. Production images never set
`kunit` and carry none of this.

## Implementation order

See [`plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md`](../../plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md) §4
(milestone chain) and §5 (live TODO list). Acceptance gates are in §4;
harness and gate mechanics in §7.
