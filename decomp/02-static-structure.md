# Phase 2 — Zero-ISA Static Structure

**Status: BASELINE LANDED (2026-08-07)** — `decomp/tools/structure-map.py` committed; `decomp/maps/210.10.1-structure.json` + `decomp/maps/README.md` written (85 candidate entries, 9 data runs, 210-unique islands w2972–w8096 and w8584–w12090, slot-19 corroboration, branch-class statistics with the `0xb3ff`→branch hypothesis revision). Refinement continues opportunistically; the remaining items are Phase 3/4 inputs, not blockers.

## Goal

Extract everything knowable about the code *without* knowing the instruction semantics: section boundaries, function skeletons, data vs code, and a cross-blob alignment map. Produces the structural scaffold Phase 3 labels and Phase 4 cracks.

## Established (evidence in findings.md)

- **Fixed-width 32-bit RISC, BE, word-addressed.** 12,851 words (210). Entropy 6.29 bits/byte → uncompressed, unencrypted.
- **24-slot dispatch table at word 0** (bytes `0x00–0xBF`): populated slot = `0xb7ffXXXX` branch word + `0xffffffff` pad; `XXXX` = target word offset counted from byte `0xC0` (word 24). Slot 0's pad word carries the version stamp. Verified empirically: computed targets land on cross-tier byte-identical code runs.
- **Lineage**: the same table/encoding exists in all 23 public blobs → one ISA family across ~15 years of FMan generations.
- **Prefix histogram** (top-16-bit, 106 vs 210): stable shared classes (`0xb3ff` ~3%, `0xebc0`, `0xd841`, `0xbc3f`, `0xf040/41/42`, `0xa3ff`…) = base ISA; **`0x0421` expands 3→120 hits (0.04%→0.93%)** and `0x0400/01/02` grow ~2.6× — new-in-210 instruction class, prime FE-VM suspect.
- Cross-tier chunk overlap (relocation-tolerant): 106↔108 = 60–77%; 210↔public = 30–42%.

## Work items

1. **CFG skeleton.** Branch encodings are half-known: harvest all words of `0xb7ff`-like classes, treat low-16-bit fields as candidate targets, keep those landing in-range. Function regions = branch-anchored extents. Block terminators are the smallest, most regular instruction subset — crack them first in Phase 4.
2. **Data/code separation.** `0xffffffff` pads (449 in 210), dispatch table, constant pools (the `b3ffNNNN`/`e9c9MMMM` unrolled loops at slot 8's target), alignment runs. Mark likely-data regions so the disassembler doesn't desync on them.
3. **Cross-blob alignment map.** Refine the 2026-08-06 chunk matcher: for every 210 region, record counterpart-in-106/108/107 or "unique". Output feeds Phase 3 directly (shared-base vs DSAR vs CAPWAP vs 210-only coloring).
4. **Section hypothesis.** 210's growth concentrates at dispatch targets 3 (1578), 6 (8574), 7 (12124), 19 (8621, 210-only), 22 (12388) — check whether unique-210 chunks cluster at those offsets.

## Deliverable

`decomp/maps/210-structure.json` (region map: extents, branch targets, data/code tag, cross-blob alignment) + rendered map in `decomp/maps/README.md`.

## Method guardrails

- A "function extent" is a hypothesis until Phase 4 confirms prologue/epilogue encodings. Mark confidence per region.
- Do not interpret semantics here. Structure only — semantic labels are Phase 3, opcode meaning is Phase 4. The hypothetical spec-§12 opcode map demonstrates how mixing these layers can produce internally consistent but incorrect conclusions.
