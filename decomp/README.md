# decomp/ — QEF 210.10.1 Microcode Disassembly Program

**Started 2026-08-07**

Status:
- Phases 0–2: complete
- Phase 3: anchors database available
- Phase 4: mutation oracle validated by E1 and E2 on the designated test DUT
- Phase 5: Ghidra toolchain available
- Phase 6: targeted algorithms extracted (ehash lookup in en-exthash-lookup.asm, FE-VM island in fe-action-interpreter.md)
- Phase 7: full deep understanding delivered (201-instruction ISA reference, 99.99% coverage; polished into `arch/fman-microcode-210-full-reference.md`)

Reverse-engineering program for the NXP FMan v3 controller microcode (QEF
container, version 210.10.1) that runs on the LS1046A's FMan. Initially scoped
to ~10 named routines, now elevated under Phase 7 to full-image comprehension
of all 12,851 words leveraging the 201-instruction controller ISA table.

This directory holds the plan, the running discovery log, and per-phase
notes — process artifacts, not a reference to read cold. The register/AD-level
contract the microcode implements is documented separately in
`arch/fman-microcode-210-programming-reference.md` (the host/driver side: what
you write into hardware tables). The controller's own execution — what the
firmware actually does with those tables once they're loaded — is written up
as a standalone manual in `arch/fman-microcode-210-full-reference.md`,
derived from this directory's Phase 7 decompilation but polished for reading
start to finish. decomp/ itself remains the audit trail behind both.

## Why this is tractable (and why it was previously judged not to be)

On 2026-07-11 the project deliberately chose observability (`fe_probe`,
`pcd-snapshot`, behavioral CRC matching) over ISA disassembly for the ASK2
EKFC/workspace questions. That call was correct for landing M3 — those
questions closed behaviorally on 2026-07-13. The blind-RE benchmark was grim:
RUB-SysSec's AMD K8/K10 microcode RE (USENIX 2017) and chip-red-pill's Intel
Goldmont disassembler were multi-year efforts reaching ~40% coverage.

This program is *not* blind RE. Four assets the AMD/Intel teams lacked:

1. **A 24-blob same-ISA differential corpus.** Proven 2026-08-07: every public
   blob from P1023 (160.0.18) through P4080/T4240/B4860/LS1043/LS1046
   (106/107/108) and our proprietary 210.10.1 shares the `0xb7ffXXXX`
   branch-word dispatch-table encoding. One fixed-width 32-bit RISC ISA,
   stable across ~15 years of NXP toolchain builds.
2. **A pre-attributed 24-entry dispatch table** at code offset 0 (arch doc
   §1.2): ~15/24 slots have candidate identities; slot 19 is a confirmed
   210-only entry point.
3. **Labeled anchors** — 106/108 implement the *documented* Host-Command
   interface, protocol constants appear as immediates, and feature-presence
   splits (106→108, 107-DSAR, 210-only) name regions by construction.
4. **A live, brick-safe mutation oracle**: kernel patch
   `0117 load_fman_ctrl_code()` re-streams whatever blob U-Boot injected into
   the DT at every boot. Patched blobs load via TFTP + the `fman_ucode` env
    var — no SPI flash writes. The designated test DUT observes the effect.

## Ground rules

- **Never write SPI flash** for microcode experiments. Mutation = TFTP-loaded
  patched blob → DT injection → kernel re-stream. A bad blob costs one reboot.
- Run mutation experiments only on the **designated development DUT**.
  Reserve the secondary DUT for recovery and independent confirmation.
- The blob is NXP proprietary, LA_OPT EULA. Do not commit the blob or derived
  disassembly listings to public remotes. Markdown analysis is fine.
- **No replacement-microcode ambition** — we have no assembler, no signing
  keys. Read-only understanding.
- **Soft-parser rabbit hole warning**: the parser's NetPDL/XML tooling is real
  and documented but programs a *different* engine. It does not unlock the
  controller microcode. Do not burn time there.
- **Decision gate** at Phase 4: if control-flow encodings are not cracked
  after ~2 weeks of oracle time, stop ISA work and fall back to the
  observability stack, which already answers the production questions.

## Working artifacts (volatile — re-acquire with the recipes in 00)

Set `DECOMP_WORKDIR=${DECOMP_WORKDIR:-/tmp/fman-decomp}` before using the
acquisition and analysis commands.

- `$DECOMP_WORKDIR/fman-ucode-210.10.1.bin` — canonical blob (SHA-256
  `5f3ed8d32b8659aafd8912d5d9920306350cae7a85884d81859152b9723eff0d`)
- `$DECOMP_WORKDIR/qoriq-fm-ucode/` — 23-blob public corpus
- The original temporary probe is superseded by
  `decomp/tools/qef-parse.py` and `decomp/tools/structure-map.py`.
