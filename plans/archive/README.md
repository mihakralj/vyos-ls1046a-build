# plans/archive/

Historical design and forensic documents preserved for bisect/audit purposes. These files describe approaches that have been **abandoned**, **superseded**, or are **dated snapshots** of work that has since landed (or been replaced).

**Do not consult these for current architecture.** They are kept because:

1. They contain accurate facts about silicon behaviour and kernel/driver internals that may be useful when re-investigating a problem.
2. They document why we chose the path we are on (the alternatives we ruled out).
3. They are reachable from older Qdrant memory entries that pre-date the archive move; preserving the filenames keeps those memory entries valid.

**Redirect-note policy (2026-07-19, user decision):** archived docs do **not**
keep a redirect stub at their old `plans/` path — `plans/` holds live documents
only. Instead each archived doc has a sibling `<name>.archive-note.md` here
recording where the content went and which qdrant-cited old path it replaces.
Old `plans/<name>.md` paths cited in pre-2026-07-19 memory entries resolve by
looking up `<name>.md` (or `<name>.md.archive-note.md`) in this directory.

For current state, see (in order of authority):

- `plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md` — **THE authoritative ASK2 execution plan — start here.** Ground state, gaps, binding architecture decisions, milestone chain M2–M8 with gates, live TODO list, open defects, harness/gate mechanics, and the superseded-document register (§8) that maps every archived ASK2 plan's content forward.
- `specs/dpaa1-afxdp-modernization-spec.md` — **the authoritative cross-flavor source-of-truth** (one DPAA1 driver core + `pcd_ops`/`qmgmt_ops`; the FMan PCD subsystem now lives in the common board stack, built-in for default/vpp/ask).
- `specs/ask2-rewrite-spec.md` — ASK2 architecture index (v1.12).
- `specs/vpp-dpaa1-ls1046a-spec.md` — VPP-flavor (AF_XDP) design spec.
- `plans/DUAL-DATAPLANE.md` — S0↔S1↔S2 state machine + per-interface CLI contract.
- `plans/archive/ASK2-PATH-A-ARCHITECTURE-DECISION-RECORD.md` — **combined Path A decision record** (merged 2026-07-14) in three parts: (1) ASK-vs-ASK2 comparative analysis, (2) architecture review, (3) course-correction execution plan.

## File index

Archived 2026-05-25 as part of the v1.3 doc consolidation following PR14z21 M2 gate run.

Archived 2026-06-08 as part of the dpaa1 cross-flavor doc consolidation: the ASK2 `ask20`-era execution/triage/test-parity trackers and the completed repo-layout / patch-migration plans (the last seven rows above) were superseded once the FMan PCD subsystem moved into the common board stack and `specs/dpaa1-afxdp-modernization-spec.md` became the cross-flavor source-of-truth.

Archived 2026-07-19 as part of the ASK2 master-plan consolidation: the seven plan documents above (journey review, development plan, completion plan, phase-2 automation, performance modernization, F3/F6 unblock proposal, and the ASK-PLANS hub) were superseded by the single authoritative `plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md`. Later the same day (user decision), the redirect stubs at their old `plans/` paths were moved into this archive as `<name>.md.archive-note.md` files, leaving `plans/` with live documents only.

Archived 2026-09-05 as part of a full `/arch`, `/decomp`, `/plans`, `/specs` doc consolidation pass: nine `plans/` documents (the nine rows above dated 2026-09-05) were retired — two because their tracked work shipped and folded into `plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md` (NAT offload task plan, F-195 progress report), one historical-churn code review whose findings are tracked in the master plan's defect register, two dated/superseded snapshots each already carrying their own `SUPERSEDED` banner (performance benchmarks, offload-capabilities inventory), one superseded old plan (VLAN offload plan, replaced by the still-live `ASK2-VLAN-REARCH.md`), one completed oracle-validation phase (NXP-106 oracle validation, superseded by the still-live NXP-106 deep-dive plan), and one roadmap stub absorbed into full design specs (soft-parser PPPoE). `plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md` §8's stale `TRAFFIC-HARNESS.md` row was removed in the same change (that file was archived too). Files still cited as live/authoritative by other current documents were deliberately left in `plans/` despite an initial read suggesting they were fully superseded: `CC-TREE-REBUILD-PLAN.md`, `NXP-106-DEEP-DIVE-PLAN.md`, `TF-2026-07-18-001-function-inventory.md`, and `ZC-RX-SCOPE.md` (all still depended on by `ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md` §8), plus `ASK2-PRODUCTION-ARCHITECTURE.md` (cited as authoritative by `specs/ask2-rewrite-spec.md`), `EHASH-DUAL-FIX-VERIFICATION-PLAN.md` (cited from `arch/fman-microcode-210-programming-reference.md`), and `ASK2-VLAN-REARCH.md` (cited as current evidence from `ASK2-BRIDGE-OFFLOAD-PLAN.md` and `specs/ask2-vlan-cli-grammar.md`) — these three were archived and then reverted once the cross-reference check surfaced the dependency.

## Maintenance rules (carried over from the archived ASK-PLANS hub)

- When an active ASK2 plan is **archived**, add its row to the index above with rationale, and verify the superseded-document register (`plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md` §8) maps its content forward — in the same change.
- New ASK2 planning content goes **into the master plan** (`plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md`), not into new plan documents.
- This index lists archives; it does **not** carry architecture. Architectural facts belong in `specs/` and `arch/` per the `AGENTS.md` spec/implementation layering rule.
