# ASK2 Architecture — Canonical Index (v1.12)

**[CORRECTION, 2026-08-11]** The "FE-VM ehash is a DEAD END / not the shipping datapath; CC-tree + SW flowtable is shipping" framing (v1.11) is now **superseded for the per-packet HIT path** by the 2026-08-11 qdrant discoveries, which together show the vendor's genuine production classification path IS external-hash:
- Vendor `.106` stack (live): `cdx.ko` production path = `insert_entry_in_classif_table()` → `ExternalHashTableAddKey()` (external ehash), full arming/offload process mapped (see `arch/fman-fe-ehash.md`, `qdrant: ask-arm-offload-every-step`).
- 999-patch HIT/PASS encoding decoded: `en_exthash_node` CC-leaf AD + `en_ehash_entry` DDR record with **16 B `t_ExtHashResult`** (per-flow MUX context + monitor stats) after the key, stats at +256 (see `arch/fman-fe-ehash.md`, `qdrant: hit-pass-flow-encoding-decoded`).
- CC-tree classification **never produced a confirmed HIT** (`cc_test` retired; M5's 10.259 Gbps is a SW-flowtable/CC-tree *throughput* result, mechanism unresolved — see `plans/ASK2-MASTER-PLAN.md` M5).

**Consequences for this index (v1.12):**
1. **The per-packet HIT path is the external ehash (FE-VM), not CC-tree.** The "DEAD END" banner below the line is retained only as historical framing; the authoritative course-corrected architecture is `plans/ASK2-PRODUCTION-ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. **M3 OPEN = the three silicon deltas** (RCCB AD species at `FMBM_RCCB`; record-side `t_ExtHashResult`; params `OFFLOAD_SUPPORT_EN` + FE buffer pool `+0x54/+0x58`) — see `plans/ASK2-PRODUCTION-ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.1/§4 Phase 2.
3. **Binding production requirement: the control surface is genl/YNL only. debugfs is `CONFIG_ASK_DEBUG_FS` / `CONFIG_FMAN_PCD_DEBUG_FS`-gated and compiled out of production images.** Consumers must never depend on `/sys/kernel/debug/ask` or `fman_pcd/fe_*`. The genl `ask` family (UAPI `kernel/ask/uapi/ask.yaml`) is the sole production engage/disengage/flow/stats path.

**[CORRECTION, 2026-08-05]** This index's "FE-VM ehash is a DEAD END / not vendor architecture" framing (v1.11 line below) is partly refuted: the genuine deployed vendor `cdx.ko` driver's production classification path IS external-hash (`insert_entry_in_classif_table()` → `ExternalHashTableAddKey()`, `cdx_ehash.c`, nxp-sdk branch) — see `arch/fman-fe-ehash.md`'s un-retirement banner and `specs/fman-keygen-flow-key-spec.md` §1.2a for the full finding, and F-163 (`kernel/ask/oot-modules/ask/ask_flow_offload.c`) for the resulting key-format fix. What is NOT refuted: the ~1.5 Gbps DDR-per-frame throughput-ceiling claim (unmeasured against real vendor traffic) and the fact that this branch's own FE-VM has still never produced a confirmed hardware HIT (a 2026-08-05 live board test, byte-correct end-to-end including the corrected key, still MISSed — see `arch/fman-microcode-210-programming-reference.md` §10.5a). Whether CC-tree remains the right *shipping* mechanism for other reasons (MURAM footprint, avoiding per-frame DDR) is a separate, still-open question this correction does not settle either way.

**Status:** Architecture index — this document maps the ASK2 architecture landscape. It does NOT contain the architecture itself. The full ASK2 rewrite spec (v1.1–v1.7, ~6 kLOC) was retired 2026-07-14 when the Fork-B FE-VM ehash path invalidated the Fork-A/OH-port-era ceiling numbers and MURAM budget assumptions. **v1.11 (2026-08-01):** The SHIPPING HW-offload architecture is CC-tree + kernel SW flowtable + manip-chain forwarding (M5 10.259 Gbps @ 0.16% CPU). The FE-VM ehash HIT path (Fork-B) is a DEAD END — per-frame DDR hash (~1.5 Gbps ceiling), never dispatched by the CC engine, documented as experimental only. CC-tree scales to ~2000+ flows (255 keys/node, ~8 nodes in 64 KiB MURAM). CC comparator reads KG-emitted bytes (patch 0108 cc_pack_key rewrite); EKFC order MSB-first (SIP,DIP,PROTO,SPORT,DPORT). S1 (ASK) redefined as CC-tree + SW flowtable + manip chain. Per-interface CLI contract (`set interfaces ethernet eth<n> offload ask`, per-interface ASK↔VPP mutex, `system offload classify` CLI deprecated — mechanism kept as silent default).
