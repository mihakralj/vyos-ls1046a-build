# additive-cp never deleted patches removed/renamed from data/ on a reused
# local checkout, so obsolete patch files (e.g. a stale 019-*.patch long
# since removed from data/) lingered forever and were fed to git apply as
# phantom failures. On a fresh CI clone this never showed up (nothing to
# accumulate); on a persistent local dev-build machine it silently built up.

# exist, and its `git checkout <commit_id>` never resets a dirty tree -- the
# right behavior for a fresh CI runner, but on a reused local checkout the
# vyos-1x working tree accumulates every previous run's already-applied
# patch modifications, so patches that apply perfectly cleanly on pristine
# upstream fail here with spurious "does not match index" / 3-way merge
# errors. Reset before build.py touches it, if a prior checkout exists.

  # build.py's own `git checkout <commit_id>` runs after this and will land
  # on the right branch/ref regardless of what HEAD currently points to.
  # Track upstream: the persistent clone's local refs go stale between
  # runs; resetting to a stale HEAD + build.py's `git checkout rolling`
  # then builds an OLD upstream commit against which our patches drift
  # (ARM64-runner2 2026-08-14: 12 patch failures from a stale clone).

# that broke 5 patches in one night (see plans/, git log around 2026-09-10).
# A "new file mode" patch hunk IS the file's content; tracking it as a plain
# file here and copying it into place (pre_build_hook, below) is equivalent
# and can never suffer context drift. Only files that ALSO modify an existing
# upstream file (e.g. registering a new .py in a Makefile) stay patch-format.

# The MOTD patch (vyos-1x-012) hardcodes its banner text; there is no
# @@FLAVOR@@ placeholder to substitute any more. The flavor split was retired
# 2026-06-14 and the FLAVOR variable removed 2026-07-26 — the banner now
# names the dual-dataplane model instead of a build flavor.

# NOTE: pre_build_hook MUST be a TOML *literal* multi-line string ('''...''')
# not a TOML basic multi-line string ("""...""").  The basic string interprets
# backslash escapes, so a `\"` inside the bash sed pattern gets unescaped to a
# literal `"` BEFORE bash sees it — turning  sed -i "/^# For \"X\"$/.../d"
# into   sed -i "/^# For "X"$/.../d"   which bash then word-splits on the
# embedded quotes, leaving the unquoted argument  /^# For X$/.../d  that no
# longer matches the upstream  # For "nat64"  / # End "nat64"  block headers.
# Result: jool + nat-rtsp dependencies are NOT stripped, vyos-1x.deb fails to
# install in lb chroot. Verified failure mode in run 25706953044 (2026-05-12).
# Literal '''...''' passes the body through verbatim, so bash receives \"
# unmolested and converts it to " correctly.

  #   E1111: assigning-from-no-return     (interfaces_wireless.py:179)

  #          treats them as Python, which obviously fails to parse.  Old
  #          pylint silently skipped non-.py extensions.
  # All three are real upstream bugs that vyos itself never fails CI on
  # because their builder uses old pylint.  Disabling matches upstream
