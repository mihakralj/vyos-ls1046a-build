"""F-224 (Phase A): program the 46-byte dual-lane GEC key on the AC_CC FE scheme.

Silicon-proven design (specs/ask2-ipv6-dual-lane-key-design.md, Stage-1/2 exact
crc64 matches 2026-08-21): replace the 14-byte EKFC key (0x801c0006) on the
engaged AC_CC scheme with a single all-GEC 46-byte dual-lane key that carries
BOTH IPv4 and IPv6 in one fixed width, so ONE match-all scheme + ONE per-port
table serve both families with NO parser LCV split (the LCV split is the
D-1-proven dual-v6 wedge).

46-byte key layout (GEC concatenation order):
  [0]    FAMILY   L3 header byte 0 masked 0xF0 (0x40 v4 / 0x60 v6) gec=0x80F07B00
  [1..8] IPv4 src+dst @ IP hdr +12, VALIDATED code 0x0b        gec=0x87FF0B0C
  [9..24]  IPv6 src @ IP6 hdr +8,  VALIDATED code 0x1b         gec=0x8FFF1B08
  [25..40] IPv6 dst @ IP6 hdr +24, VALIDATED code 0x1b         gec=0x8FFF1B18
  [41]   proto/nexthdr  IP_PID_NO_V 0x72                        gec=0x80FF7200
  [42..45] L4 src+dst   L4_NO_V 0x7e                            gec=0x83FF7E00

VALIDATED address codes (0x0b/0x1b) are mandatory: when the frame's family does
NOT match, the extract substitutes the default register (reset 0), full width,
so the absent family's lane is a deterministic zero fill (vendor fm_kg.c +
silicon-confirmed: v4 frame -> v6 lanes 16+16 zero; v6 frame -> v4 lane 8 zero).
The no-validate L3 code (0x7b) would overread instead — do NOT use it here.

WHERE: keygen_scheme_setup(), the `if (scheme->ekfc)` override block. Gated to
the FE scheme only (scheme->next_engine == 3) so RSS (0), policer (1), and the
CCBS implicit-walk (2) schemes keep EKFC/GEC untouched. For the FE scheme we
force kgse_ekfc = 0 (all-GEC key, no known/EKFC fields) and write kgse_gec[0..5]
with the six constants; gec[6..7] stay 0 (memset). kgse_dv0/dv1/ekdv are already
zeroed in this block (F-179), which is exactly the zero default the absent-lane
substitution reads.

This CHANGES THE PROVEN v4 KEY FORMAT (14-byte EKFC -> 46-byte GEC). Phase A ships
this v4-only (v6 gate OFF) and is REGRESSION-GATED: v4 must still HIT at
7.29 Gbit/s with the 46-byte key before v6 is enabled or this ships. Companion
edits: F-188 ehash_key_sz 14->46, F-220 per-port table keysize 14->46, ask.ko
46-byte dual-lane serializer.

Must run AFTER F-209 (CCOBASE) and any fixup that edits this EKFC block. Idempotent.
