# rewired this loop to the kernel/common/ canonical location, also
# moving the previously-orphan ls1046a-dpaa1.config in as 08-dpaa1.config.

# ── Staging-completeness guard
# 0078 (dpaa MODULE_SOFTDEP on af_xdp_pool) intentionally NOT staged:
# under CONFIG_FSL_DPAA_ETH=y and CONFIG_DPAA_AF_XDP_POOL=y the softdep
# is unreachable (modprobe never loads either of them). Autoload is
# guaranteed by the =y flip in kernel/common/kernel-config/08-dpaa1.config
# instead — af_xdp_pool_init() runs at late_initcall before
# dpaa_eth_probe()'s register_netdev().
# M3-3 step 1: bind a real NAPI to qmap[].napi at xsk_pool_attach time
# (BSP cpu 0's per-CPU NAPI portal) and stop xsk_set_rx_need_wakeup being
# a stub. First reviewable slice of Phase 3 per spec sec 5.2 final paragraph
# + sec 5.4 RX path step 5. No throughput change yet — control-plane
# wiring; ZC RX/TX datapath lands in 0081+.
# M3-3 step 2a: distribute qband NAPI across online CPUs.  Promotes
# the cpu=0 stopgap from 0080 to (queue_id % num_online_cpus()) so
# four-qband bindings fan out across all four LS1046A A72 cores
# instead of piling onto cpu 0's QMan SWP.  Still no dedicated BMan
# channels (step 2b) and no cluster-aware refinement (step 2c).
# Spec sec 5.2 "Queue mapping correctness" items 3-5.
# M3-3 step 2b: observability for step 2a's pointer wiring. Adds the
# /sys/kernel/debug/af_xdp_pool/qmap node so priv->qmap[].napi/.cpu can
# be verified per-netdev without kgdb or a crash dump. Pure observability —
# zero datapath change, zero new core-driver exports. Spec sec 5.2.
# M3-3 step 3: real dpaa_fq_to_qband() + xsk_rx_branch counter +
# observational RX hot-path eligibility probe. Strictly diagnostic --
# no datapath change. ZC redirect lands in 0084+. Spec sec 6.1.2.
# M3-3 step 4: NAPI-hooked BMan refill from the XSK fill ring + new
# xsk_bman_refill_batches counter. Folded into the existing rcu_read_lock()
# block in dpaa_eth_poll() right after xsk_set_rx_need_wakeup. With no XSK
# pool bound the new ops->napi_refill callback walks zero
# bound qbands and returns; no datapath cost. Spec sec 6.1.3.
# M3-3 step 5: TX ZC submission + xsk_tx_inflight backpressure + TxConf
# round-trip closure. Three new flavor ops (napi_tx_zc, xsk_set_tx_need_wakeup,
# tx_conf_zc) wired into dpaa_eth_poll() tail (same RCU section as 0084) and
# dpaa_tx_conf() head. Two new ethtool counters (xsk_tx_zc_submit,
# xsk_tx_conf_zc). With no XSK pool bound all three ops
# walk zero bound qbands and the tx_conf_zc claim probe returns false on
# bpid mismatch -- skb fast path unchanged. ≥ 7 Gbps acceptance gate on
# VPP dataplane. Spec sec 6.1.4.
# M3-3b: FMan PCD capability detection + CC-steering stub API. Adds
# CONFIG_DPAA_HW_CC_STEERING (default y), priv->fman_caps snapshot via
# dpaa_fman_get_caps() at probe, one-shot KERN_INFO log, hw_offload_unavailable
# ethtool counter, and the four fman_cc_tree_*() stubs returning -ENOTSUPP.
# Observability-only -- mainline ucode 106 silicon shows caps=0x00 and every
# productive call short-circuits. dpaa_fman_caps.force= module parameter
# lets developers simulate ucode 210 for unit testing downstream consumers
# (af_xdp_pool qband-select, ASK2 flowtable bridge, vyos-1x classify CLI).
# Spec sec 3.5 + sec 5.4.
# M3-3 step 6 blocker A residual: DMA device mismatch between the XSK
# pool map (was: parent MAC device, 32-bit mask) and the BMan FBPR
# validation domain (FMan RX port device, 40-bit mask). Switches
# xsk_pool_dma_map() to priv->rx_dma_dev, the same device mainline uses
# for dpaa_bp_add_8_bufs(). The two earlier blocker-A hot-fixes
# (0086 chunked release-by-8, 0087 pre-zero bmbs[i].data) were absorbed
# into 0084 v3 directly -- the patch stack is now stand-alone. Spec
# sec 6.1.5 / 6.1.6.
# M3-3b productive: replace the dpaa_fman_caps.force= stub body of
# dpaa_fman_get_caps() with a real DT walk of the FMan firmware blob
# (/proc/device-tree/soc/fman@1a00000/fman-firmware/fsl,firmware,
# struct qe_firmware id field at bytes 8..69). Parses the "Microcode
# version <maj>.<min>.<rev> ..." string and lights up
# FMAN_CAP_CC_EXACT_MATCH | FMAN_CAP_HM_NODES | FMAN_CAP_POLICER_TRTCM
# | FMAN_CAP_PARSER_SOFTSEQ when major >= 210 (verified on Mono Gateway
# DK 2026-05-28: u-boot loads 210.10.1 from SPI mtd4). HC_DISPATCH stays
# off per PR13 finding -- the stock 210.10.1 QEF blob does not implement
# the HC doorbell. force= still wins as operator override. Caps are
# cached after first DT probe so subsequent dpaa_eth_probe() calls (5x
# on this board) don't re-walk. Spec sec 3.5.
# M3-3c: HM (Header Manipulation) stub API. Mirrors the 0086 cadence
# exactly -- fman_hm_node_install/destroy stubs return -ENOTSUPP,
# fman_hm_caps_supported() wraps (caps & FMAN_CAP_HM_NODES). Adds
# CONFIG_DPAA_HW_HM_OFFLOAD (default y, depends on DPAA_HW_CC_STEERING)
# and struct fman_hm_spec opaque type. Productive impl lands in a
# follow-up patch; API is fixed now so downstream consumers (af_xdp_pool
# egress rewrite, vyos-1x NAT offload CLI, ASK2 flowtable bridge) can
# wire calls today and gracefully degrade on ucode <210 silicon. Spec
# sec 5.5.
# M3-3d: Policer (srTCM/trTCM) stub API. Mirrors the 0090 cadence exactly --
# fman_policer_install returns -ENOTSUPP, fman_policer_destroy is an
# idempotent void no-op, fman_policer_caps_supported() wraps
# (caps & FMAN_CAP_POLICER_TRTCM). Adds CONFIG_DPAA_HW_POLICER_OFFLOAD
# (default y, depends on DPAA_HW_CC_STEERING) and opaque struct
# fman_policer_profile. Productive impl lands in a follow-up patch; API is
# fixed now so downstream consumers (vyos-1x firewall limit offload CLI,
# VPP per-qband rate-limit, ASK2 nft limit offload backend) can wire calls
# today and gracefully degrade on ucode <210 silicon. Spec sec 5.6.
# M3-3b productive struct contract: replaces the opaque {u32 reserved;}
# placeholders for struct fman_cc_key / fman_cc_static_tree (from 0086)
# with the real 5-tuple key + static-tree layout per spec sec 5.4. The
# four fman_cc_tree_* entry points stay -ENOTSUPP stubs; only the API
# struct shape becomes productive so downstream consumers (af_xdp_pool
# qband-select, vyos-1x classify CLI, ASK2 flowtable bridge) can build
# real specs. The silicon AD/group-table CONT_LOOKUP encoding lands in a
# follow-up. Applies on the final post-0091 dpaa_fman_caps.h. Spec sec 5.4.
# M3-3c productive struct contract: replaces the opaque struct
# fman_hm_spec {u32 reserved;} placeholder (from 0090) with the real
# ordered-op-list layout (enum fman_hm_op_type + VLAN/MPLS op params +
# ops[8]) per spec sec 5.5. fman_hm_* entry points stay -ENOTSUPP stubs.
# Must apply AFTER 0086b (both edit dpaa_fman_caps.h). Spec sec 5.5.
# M3-3d productive struct contract: replaces the opaque struct
# fman_policer_profile {u32 reserved;} placeholder (from 0091) with the

# FMan PCD (Parse/Classify/Distribute) orchestration subsystem — COMMON
# Forward-port of the ask20 0004 skeleton re-anchored to

# hunks) — independent of the 0086/0090/0091 dpaa_fman_caps.h stub chain,
# applies last among board patches by sort order. Unblocks M3-3b/c/d:
# the per-engine CC/HM/Policer bodies (follow-up patches) reach the FMan

# 0097 (PR2): FMan PCD KeyGen exact-match scheme API. Builds on 0092 —

# keygen_bind_port_to_schemes helpers, then adds fman_pcd_kg.c + the public
# fman_pcd_kg_* KG surface (scheme_create/bind_port/attach_cc/scheme_destroy).
# IPv4 5-tuple match-vector via KGSE_MV (RM 8.7.4); attach_cc stays -EOPNOTSUPP
# until the CC tree subsystem lands. Common (built-in via FSL_FMAN_PCD) for
# default/vpp/ask alike. Numbered 0097 (not 0093) to avoid colliding with the
# pre-existing 0093-dpaa1-true-zc-rx-eligibility-probe.patch; 0097 sorts after
# 0092 (PCD skeleton) AND after the unrelated 0093-0096 true-ZC patches (which

# 0098 (PR3): FMan CC static-tree install (productive, M3-3b). Builds on

# 0110: true-ZC RX NAPI-only hook dispatch + xdp_do_flush (supersedes the

# path: (1) missing xdp_do_flush() after XSKMAP redirect -- the local

# never ran (redirect>0 but probe rx_packets=0); (2) FATAL hard-IRQ panic
# in __xsk_map_flush -- 0103f dispatched the rx_hook BEFORE mainline's
# dpaa_eth_napi_schedule() deferral, so the hook + flush ran in portal_isr
# hard-IRQ context, corrupting the per-context xsk flush list across CPUs
# (dual-CPU Oops, HW 2026-06-10). Fix: defer to NAPI first when a hook is
# registered (qman_cb_dqrr_stop on hard IRQ; QMan re-delivers in NAPI),
# plus WARN_ON_ONCE(in_hardirq()) bail at hook entry. HW-validated
# 2026-06-10: functional PASS, SIGKILL-teardown stress PASS, 8-way flood

# root->leaf only; LEAF_TO_INNER -> -EOPNOTSUPP. txqs: alloc grows to

# M3-3b wedge fix: SDK-convergent CC bring-up (root CONT_LOOKUP AD, RESULT
# leaf ADs, productive FMBM_RCCB bind + NIA_KG_CC_EN via fman_port_lookup_rx
# registry, KG NIA=FM_CTL|AC_CC with CCBS=grpBits). Spec §5.4, v5.19.
# M3-3b wedge fix iteration 3: CC result-AD NIA must exit via FM_CTL
# AC_NO_IPACC_PRE_BMI_ENQ_FRAME (0x28) on A006675/SW006 silicon — the 0115
# direct NIA_ENG_BMI|ENQ exit leaked one FMan task per CC-dispatched frame
# (MAC RDRP ate everything, no FPM stall, reboot-only). Also brings up the
# per-port FM_CTL ctrl-params page (FMBM_RGPR) the 0x28 ucode consumes.
# M3-3b ROOT-CAUSE fix (iter-25): mainline fman_init() clear_iram()s the
# U-Boot-uploaded FM_CTL microcode and never reloads it — IRAM all-0xFF,
# IREADY=0, so every CC dispatch (KG→FM_CTL|AC_CC) parks its FMan task and
# leaks BMI FIFO units (freeze @~46 frames). 0117 re-uploads the DTB QEF
# blob (proprietary 210.10.1, fman-firmware/fsl,firmware) into IRAM right
# after clear_iram, per SDK LoadFmanCtrlCode (fm.c:426-480). Spec §5.4.
# M3-3b iter-48 fix: revert 0115's KeyGen→CC dispatch encoding back to the
# HW-proven CCBS model (KGSE_MODE NIA = BMI direct-enqueue 0x80500002 +
# KGSE_CCBS = CC root group-table MURAM offset). 0115's AC_CC NIA-flip
# (0x80000006, ccbs=0) was DISPROVEN on hardware: with 0115's RCCB bind +
# 0116's SDK result-AD + 0117's 210.10.1 ucode all present it still stalls
# the FMan port on the first CC frame, whereas live-rewriting the scheme to
# CCBS cured the stall (no STL/60s, ping 5/5). Keeps the rest of 0115/0116/
# 0117 — only the 3 KeyGen/CC-scheme files revert. Spec §5.4.
# ASK2 M2 step 1: extend the HM op-set (0090a/0099) with 3 additive
# L3-forward primitives — RMV_ETHERNET, INSRT_GENERIC, IPV4_FORWARD —
# across all four HM layers. SDK-grounded encodings (NXP fm_manip): single
# generic HMAN_OC=0x35 HMTD, RMV=0x01000e00 / INSRT=0x02000e00+BE payload /
# IPV4=0x0c040001 (TTL+L4 checksum). No existing VLAN/MPLS op altered.
# ASK2 M2 step 2: dormant next-hop HM dedup refcount API
# (fman_hm_nexthop_get/put) caches+refcounts one shared HMTD per L3
# adjacency (egress_tx_fqid, src_mac, dst_mac) so MURAM scales
# O(next-hops) not O(flows). EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, dormant (ask.ko consumes).
# ASK2 Gap-A: export two net_device -> hardware-id resolvers
# (dpaa_get_rx_fman_port / dpaa_get_tx_fqid) on the common dpaa_fman_caps.h
# substrate so the OOT ask.ko PCD consumer can derive the fman_cc_tree_*
# port key and a CC target_fqid. EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, dormant (no in-tree
# caller). Bodies are the proven retired-ASK-tree 0031/0039 reparented.
# ASK2 Fork B M1 step 1: FE-object MURAM pool scaffold (arch/fman-fe-ehash.md
# §3 AllocFEObjs). Lazy + refcounted pool of 100×28 B FE records carved from
# FMan MURAM, driven by a new debugfs fman_pcd/<id>/fe_pool (0644) get/put
# node. fe_lock → pcd->lock order; a pristine S0 keeps the pool empty so
# engage→disengage nets zero gen_pool used (pcd-snapshot reversibility gate).
# Single-file fman_pcd.c, internal/static, no ABI export. Scaffold only —
# allocates+zeroes MURAM, does NOT program the FE records and does NOT flow
# traffic; the FE-VM core (FmPcdCcBuildFE/ContextByFE) lands later from lf-5.4.
# ASK2 Fork B M1 step 2: per-port FE support (arch/fman-fe-ehash.md §4
# FmPortSetFESupport/FmPortDeleteFESupport). Carves a per-port FE internal-
# buffer pool (total_tnums × 0x100 × 2, 256 B aligned) + a management free-list
# (5 + total_tnums bytes) from FMan MURAM, then writes the port's existing
# FM_CTL ctrl-params page +0x54 (mgmt index) / +0x58 (depletion count) — never
# allocating that page itself (it must pre-exist from a CC install, 0116) so the
# gate stays leak-clean. A faithful inverse (page→0, free mgmt, free pool, list
# del) makes engage→disengage net zero gen_pool used (pcd-snapshot gate). Adds
# fman_port_get_total_tnums() accessor (fman_port.c/.h). Driven by a new debugfs
# fman_pcd/<id>/fe_port (0644) "set <id>"/"del <id>" node. Allocate-only —
# ships DORMANT, does NOT flow classified traffic (needs §5 + FE-VM core).
# Sorts after 0122, before 101-sfp. Spec arch/fman-fe-ehash.md §4 (M1 Fork B).
# ASK2 Fork B M1 — FE virtual-machine core, increment 1 (arch/fman-fe-ehash.md
# §5 FE-VM). Transcribes the lf-5.4 SDK FmPcdCcBuildFE() descriptor encoder and
# the FM_PCD_Init() FE-singleton setup, adapted to mainline gen_pool MURAM (the
# SDK next-FE phys == the gen_pool offset fman_pcd_muram_alloc returns). Adds
# fman_pcd_fe_build() (big-endian MURAM image words via iowrite32be) plus the
# three core MUX/Transition/Exit singletons, programmed into pool slots from a
# new debugfs fman_pcd/<id>/fe_singletons (0644) "build"/"clear" node with a
# byte-level readback for oracle verification (§8.6 contract item 6). Ships
# DORMANT: programs FE descriptors but nothing dispatches into the FE machine
# until §5 ehash + the per-flow ENQ FE + AC_CC root-AD FE_ENTER wiring land.
# Forward (build) + inverse (clear) in this one patch; clear restores the exact
# pre-build pool state and pool_free drains the singletons, so pcd-snapshot
# gen_pool "used" returns to baseline (reversibility gate stays clean).
# ASK2 Fork B M1 — §5 ExternalHashTableSet (arch/fman-fe-ehash.md §5/§6). The
# vendor enhanced-ehash flow store — the only config proven to FLOW on 210.10.1
# (§8). Lazily reserves a per-PCD internal-buffer-management MURAM pool (32 KiB
# pool + 256 B global, 256-aligned, refcounted — the dominant pcd-snapshot
# reversibility signal) and per-table DDR bucket arrays (kzalloc, 16 B/bucket;
# buckets MUST stay in DDR — §6 327×-ENOMEM wall) plus an en_exthash_node DDR
# template (lf-5.4 native LE packing). New debugfs fman_pcd/<id>/fe_ehash (0644)
# "set <mask_hex> <keysize> <shift>" / "clear" with node-word readback. Bounds-
# checks MURAM before reserving (§8.6 item 2). Ships DORMANT: allocates + encodes
# only; nothing dispatches into the hash store until the fm_cc.c FE_ENTER wrapper
# + FE-VM core land. Forward (set) + inverse (clear/drain) in one patch; clear
# returns gen_pool "used" to baseline (reversibility gate stays clean).
# 0126 — convert fman_pcd_muram_alloc/_free into a gen_pool sub-allocator over
# the reserved 64 KiB MURAM partition (0092 reserved the arena but the wrappers
# re-called the GLOBAL fman_muram_alloc, competing for the ~21 KiB post-CAM/FIFO
# free tail while the reservation sat dead-weight → §5/0125 int-buf 33 KiB hit
# -ENOMEM on HW 2026-06-16). Seeds a gen_pool (min_alloc_order=8, 256 B granule)
# with [muram_offset,+64KiB); all PCD MURAM now sub-allocates from it, bounding
# PCD use to the reservation and unblocking the FE/ehash forward path. Substrate
# change — full S0↔S1 + fe_pool + fe_ehash forward regression gate required.
# 0127 — FE-VM core increment 2 (arch/fman-fe-ehash.md §5): the per-flow ENQ
# Flow-Entry (FmPcdCcBuildContextByFE — ENQ-type FE carrying the 24-bit target
# FQID in word1) and the AC_CC root action-descriptor FE_ENTER wiring
# (FillAdOfTypeContLookup external-hash branch — CONT_LOOKUP AD: ccAdBase
# 0x40800000, pcAndOffsets 0xf6, gmask = MURAM offset of the FE to enter).
# Together they give a classified frame a terminal BMI-FIFO disposition. New
# debugfs fman_pcd/<id>/fe_enq ("build <fqid_hex> [next_fe_off_hex]" / "clear")
# and fe_enter ("build [fe_off_hex]" / "clear"), each with byte-level readback.
# Ships DORMANT (programs descriptors only; nothing dispatches into the FE VM
# until the ehash bucket indexer lands). Forward+inverse in one patch; each
# inverse re-zeros + frees its MURAM so pcd-snapshot stays reversible.
# 0128: FE-VM core increment 3 — per-flow ehash insertion (arch/fman-fe-ehash.md
# §5). The SDK get_indexed_hash_bucket() CRC64 bucket indexer +
# ExternalHashTableAddKey() head-insert: CRC64 the key → byte-shift+mask to a
# bucket → allocate a 256-byte DDR flow record (en_ehash_entry) → write the
# header (flags + next_entry chain to the old bucket head), the key, and the
# next-FE pointer (the 0127 ENQ FE MURAM offset) → head-insert
# (bucket->h = swab64(phys(record))). Links a classified 5-tuple to its ENQ FE.
# New debugfs fman_pcd/<id>/fe_flow ("add <tbl_idx> <key_hex> [enq_fe_off_hex]" /
# "clear") with byte-level readback. Buckets+records live in DDR by design (§6
# anti-pattern: never fall the flow store to MURAM) so gen_pool "used" is
# UNCHANGED — reversibility = all records freed + every bucket head restored.
# Ships DORMANT; forward (add) + inverse (LIFO drain, byte-exact) in one patch.
# 0129: M1 coarse ask offload engage/disengage mode-switch (fman_pcd.h export).
# Adds two EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL entry points to fman_pcd.c + their prototypes to
# <linux/fsl/fman_pcd.h>: fman_pcd_offload_engage()/_disengage(struct fman *,
# u8 hw_port_id). They resolve the PCD internally (fman_get_pcd()) and wrap the
# EXACT HW-proven reversible sequence from the cc_test harness (0107) + 100x
# soak: install a benign single-key CC tree → get_base → KGSE_CCBS graft of the
# port's KeyGen scheme, with strict reverse teardown (detach FIRST, then
# destroy). The out-of-tree ask.ko mirrors only these two prototypes (into
# ask_fman_caps.h) and drives them via /sys/kernel/debug/ask/offload. Ships
# DORMANT (nothing calls them until the debugfs trigger / M7 op-mode); M1
# carries no classification semantics. Forward + inverse in one patch.
# 0130: D9.1 (M2 activate) increment 1 — switch the dormant FE/ehash flow store
# (0125 ehash table + 0128 per-flow records) from kzalloc()+virt_to_phys() to
# dma_alloc_coherent(). The en_exthash_node table-base words and each bucket head
# must carry true bus addresses (not raw physical) before the FE VM is armed, since
# the armed VM DMA-reads the bucket array and walks the record chain through
# PAMU/SMMU (arch/fman-fe-ehash.md §8.6 item 6; 0125/0128 flagged this as the
# pre-arming prerequisite). struct fman_pcd_ehash_table gains table_dma + dev
# (fman_get_dev(pcd->fman), captured so per-flow record alloc/free reaches the same
# device); struct fman_pcd_ehash_flow gains record_dma. Records+buckets stay in DDR
# (§6 anti-pattern: never MURAM) so gen_pool "used" is UNCHANGED — reversibility is
# still all records dma_free'd + every bucket head restored byte-exactly. Ships
# DORMANT (no new dispatch); the 0128 on-board record layout is byte-identical.
# Forward (dma_alloc) + inverse (dma_free) in one patch.
# 0131: D9-A (M2 activate) increment 3 — the genuine 28-byte external-hash
# Flow-Entry object (SDK t_ExtHashFe) that the 0127 FE_ENTER root AD dispatches
# into. Binds the §5 DDR bucket array (0125/0130) to the FE VM and links HIT →
# MUX singleton / MISS → Exit singleton (0124). fman_pcd gains fe_hash_off;
# fman_pcd_fe_enter_build()'s default gmask now prefers the t_ExtHashFe once
# built (falls back to the MUX singleton, the 0127 default). New debugfs node
# fe_hashfe (build/clear) with a 7-word byte-level readback for the M0 oracle
# byte-diff (arch/fman-fe-ehash.md §8.6 item 6 — validate the dormant FE image
# while quiescent BEFORE arming, since the M3-3b stall latches ZERO fault).
# Ships DORMANT; forward+inverse in one patch; gen_pool "used" returns to the
# warm-S0' baseline on clear (pcd-snapshot reversibility gate stays clean).
# 0133: D9-B (M2 activate) — correct the fe_arm encoding from the 0132 KGSE_CCBS
# placebo (next_engine=2, mode 0x80500002, which NEVER dispatches the CC walk —
# frames bypass into RSS) to the REAL AC_CC encoding. Adds a next_engine==3 branch
# in keygen_scheme_setup that emits KGSE_MODE = FM_CTL|AC_CC (0x80000006) with
# KGSE_CCBS=0, re-adds the NIA_ENG_FM_CTL / NIA_FM_CTL_AC_CC defines 0118 dropped
# (used ONLY by the new branch; the ==2 CCBS graft, policer, M1-engage and RSS
# paths are byte-unchanged), and flips fman_pcd_kg_port_arm_fe() to next_engine=3 /
# cc_bits_sel=0. The FMBM_RCCB write (→ FE_ENTER root AD) is unchanged. disarm is
# unchanged (forces next_engine=0). Ships DORMANT: the encoding only takes effect
# on an explicit echo to the fman_pcd/<id>/fe_arm node. This is the make-or-break
# M2 dispatch experiment — the only encoding that genuinely enters the FE VM
# terminal disposition a bare exact-match leaf lacks (M3-3b iter-50 park).
# 0133: D9-B (M2 activate) — adds AC_CC keygen_scheme_setup branch (board 0133 v1); arm function now in 0132 v3
# 0134: CAAM/QI descriptor sharing for ASK2 IPsec HW offload (spec §8.1, PR10).
# Adds caam_qi_ext_consumer_register()/_release() to drivers/crypto/caam/qi.c +
# the ext_lock/ext_active fields in struct caam_drv_ctx (qi.h) + the new header
# include/linux/crypto/caam_qi_share.h, so a future in-kernel consumer (ask.ko's
# CAAM/xfrm datapath) can dequeue completed CAAM frames from a chosen sink FQID.
# Forward-ported VERBATIM from kernel/ask/patches/0001-caam-qi-share.patch,
# which was NEVER staged after the 2026-06-14 flavor collapse killed the dead
# ask-only gate. Touches ONLY drivers/crypto/caam/* + a new header — zero
# overlap with the FMan PCD board patches, so apply order is irrelevant. Exports
# the symbols EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL but they stay dormant (no caller until the CAAM
# datapath lands). This cp line is MANDATORY — the staging-completeness guard
# below fails the build if any board/*.patch lacks one.
# 0135: FE-VM context builder — port of lf-5.4 LSDK FmPcdCcBuildContextByFE().
# Adds fman_pcd_fe_context_build() + struct fman_pcd_fe_context_params (the
# centralized per-FE context writer the SDK calls at 999-patch line 8954).
# Ships dormant (no callers yet — callers wire in a later patch to populate
# MUX/TRANSITION/ENQ/HM per-instance context after the FE descriptor build,
# matching the SDK two-step FmPcdCcBuildFE→FmPcdCcBuildContextByFE sequence).
# 0136: TX confirm bypass — fman_port_set_silicon_hit_release_mode().
# Flips the TX port BMI to release silicon-HIT FDs (FCO=0) directly to BMan
# without QMan TX-confirm enqueue.  Kernel TX (FCO=1) is unaffected.
# This eliminates the ~20% CPU softirq floor proved on hardware 2026-05-25.
# 0137: MANIP creation + chain API for L3 forwarding (fman_pcd_manip_create/_destroy/_chain_create/_chain_destroy/_hmtd_off).
# ASK2 M2.2: external flow-offload backend registration slot (single-slot

# Every .patch file in kernel/common/patches/board/ must be listed in

# This catches orphaned patches with no series entry (the old guard
# caught forgotten cp lines — now the loop reads series directly so
# the failure mode is a patch file committed without a series entry).
# 2026-08-04: 0127/0128/0129 filenames below are untracked on-disk WIP that
# collides with the REAL, already-committed, in-series patches of the same
# number (0127-fman-pcd-fe-vm-enq-root.patch, 0128-fman-pcd-fe-vm-flow-
# insert.patch, 0129-fman-pcd-offload-engage.patch — unrelated FE-VM/ehash
# work). Content looks like a genuine MURAM segregated-fit allocator +
# Risk #13 fix, but it was never renumbered/reviewed, so it is excluded
# here rather than either overwriting the real 0127-0129 or guessing new
# numbers for unreviewed content. 0138 has no number collision but is
# skipped alongside it for the same reason (unreviewed, depends on 0128/0129

### Post-defconfig: force LS1046A built-in configs after VyOS snippets
#
# VyOS config/*.config snippets are merged onto our LS1046A defconfig
# additions via `scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh` (T8506, upstream
# vyos-build 2026-05). For symbols also set by VyOS snippets, the
# VyOS value wins (later in the merge order) — e.g. USB_STORAGE=m
# (VyOS) overrides our USB_STORAGE=y. This block injects scripts/config
# --set-val overrides AFTER merge_config.sh has produced .config to force
# the LS1046A-required values back in.
#
# History: pre-T8506 upstream ran `make vyos_defconfig` after `cat`-ing all
# snippets onto the defconfig, and our anchor was the `make vyos_defconfig`
# line. Upstream replaced that step with merge_config.sh on 2026-05; the
# old anchor no longer exists. The injection-anchor verification below
# ensures any future upstream refactor fails loudly instead of silently
# no-opping (which is exactly what would have shipped a kernel without
# our forced builtins).

### Replace upstream `patch -p1` loop with `git apply --3way`.
#
# Upstream vyos-build build-kernel.sh applies kernel patches with:
#     for patch in $(ls ${PATCH_DIR}); do
#         patch -p1 < ${PATCH_DIR}/${patch}
#     done
# This loop:
#   - uses GNU patch (not git apply), so no blob-SHA-anchored 3-way merge,
#   - does NOT check the exit code, so a failed hunk leaves a .rej file
#     and the build continues with a partially-patched kernel,
#   - sorts via `ls` (locale-dependent) instead of `find ... | sort`.
# This silent-failure mode shipped a kernel without the OEM/SFP-10G-T
# quirk on ISO 2026.05.10-2322 (see commit c35005e changelog).
#
# We rewrite the loop to:
#   - turn the kernel tree into a throwaway git repo so `git apply --3way`
#     has blob-of-record as the 3-way merge base,
#   - iterate patches via `find … | sort` (deterministic),
#   - apply each with `git apply --3way --whitespace=nowarn`,
#   - ABORT the build on first failure (no silent .rej drops),
#   - commit the post-patch tree so any subsequent injection (e.g. the
#     LP5812 force-config block) sees the patched state.
#
# Idempotent via SENTINEL marker — re-running ci-setup-kernel.sh is a
# no-op.

# Patch-less source modification: add TC_SETUP_FT case to dpaa_setup_tc()
# TC_SETUP_FT is required by nf_flow_table_offload_setup() when the
# netdev has ndo_setup_tc.  Without it, nft 'flags offload' never
# reaches flow_indr_dev_setup_offload() — dpaa_setup_tc() returns
# -EOPNOTSUPP from its default: case.  Injected via sed (not a
# .patch file) to avoid the git apply --3way context-matching wall.
#
# IMPORTANT (2026-08-23 fix): the earlier form of this injection matched
# 'case TC_SETUP_BLOCK:' and inserted an unconditional
# 'return dpaa_setup_tc_flow_block(...)' right after it. That predated
# board patch 0145, which had already rewritten the TC_SETUP_BLOCK case to
# try the ingress-policer block handler FIRST (dpaa_setup_tc_block) and only
# fall through to the ASK flow-offload backend on -EOPNOTSUPP. The old
# injection therefore SHADOWED the policer path: every TC_SETUP_BLOCK bind
# returned via the ASK backend, dpaa_setup_tc_block() (the matchall/police
# registrar) was never invoked, and 'tc ... matchall action police skip_sw'
# failed with EOPNOTSUPP (ask.ko: "unexpected tc_setup_type=4"). This broke
# the hardware ingress-policer on every shipping image.
#
# Correct shape: keep the 0145 policer-first dispatch for TC_SETUP_BLOCK and
# add TC_SETUP_FT as its OWN case routing to the flow-offload backend. Match
# the exact 4-line 0145 block so the count-gate hard-fails if 0145 ever drifts.

# F-053 RETRACTED (2026-08-07, T-M3-R "999 patch" forensic finding). The
# original rationale (below, kept for the record) assumed en_exthash_node
# word_0's hash_bytes_offset field tells hardware where the key starts
# within the DDR flow record (an 8-byte link-chain header precedes it) --
# a theory formed from a /dev/mem DDR dump, before any vendor source was
# available to check it against. It was wrong. The vendor's pristine (not
# ASK-modified) fm_pcd_ext.h documents this field via the API param that
# feeds it (t_FmPcdHashTableParams.hashShift, a DIFFERENT field from the
# genuinely-obsolete kgHashShift): "Byte offset from the beginning of the
# KeyGen hash result to the 2-bytes to be used as hash index" -- i.e. it
# controls HARDWARE's own live bucket-index derivation from a KeyGen hash,
# not DDR record layout. Vendor's real cdx_pcd.xml sets hashshift="0" on
# every one of its 16 production hashtable distributions, despite having
# the identical 8-byte DDR header this project's does -- proving the field
# has nothing to do with skipping it. This project's own software bucket
# placement (fman_pcd_ehash_bucket_index(), patch 0128) has always used
# t->hash_shift=0 (every `fe_ehash set` call this project has ever run
# passed 0), unaffected by this fixup. Forcing hash_bytes_offset=1 in the
# AD word means hardware's live bucket-index derivation (if it reads this
# field the same way) computes a DIFFERENT bucket than the one software
# inserted into -- a silent, structural, always-present mismatch
# mechanistically consistent with the zero-HIT symptom chased across
# F-141 through F-177. Original F-053 rationale, kept for the record:
# "The DDR flow record (en_ehash_entry) has an 8-byte link-chain header
# (flags + next_entry pointer) before the key data at
# FMAN_EHASH_FLOW_KEY_OFF=8. The hardware descriptor field
# hash_bytes_offset (bits 17:16 of ad[0]) was being written with
# t->hash_shift (0), telling the hardware to start key comparison at byte
# 0 of the DDR record -- comparing against the link header (all zeros for
# the first flow) + partial key, which NEVER matches the KG-extracted
# bytes. The correct value for an 8-byte header is 1 (the field encodes
# 0->0B, 1->8B)." No mutation applied now -- hash_bytes_offset reverts to
# tracking t->hash_shift dynamically, matching every vendor production
# table's value (0) for this project's own test configuration.

# F-054: Fix context_build overwriting FE Action Descriptors.
# fman_pcd_fe_build_contexts() calls fman_pcd_fe_context_build(fe, offset, &p)
# where fe is the AD base address and offset is 0 for MUX.  context_build
# writes at fe+offset = fe+0 — the MUX AD type header (0x04000000) gets
# replaced with enq->muram_off.  The hardware reads a garbage FE type and
# crashes when HIT fires and tries to follow the next-FE pointer.
#
# Fix: replace context_build for MUX and Transition with direct AD writes.
# MUX AD word 0 becomes FMAN_FE_TYPE_MUX|enq_off (type+next-FE in one word).
# Transition AD word 1 becomes the exit FE offset (correct 2-word layout).

# engine: the single AD-type extraction site (c600001e >>30 @ w1857,

### PR14z2 fix #4 (v2): persistent signing key + post-build snapshot from headers .deb
#
# Background: linux 6.18.31's `make bindeb-pkg` chain runs `make clean`
# AFTER producing the binary .debs, wiping Module.symvers, certs/signing_key.*,
# .config, scripts/sign-file, scripts/mod/modpost, include/{config,generated},
# arch/arm64/include/generated. Three earlier attempts failed:
#   (1) DPKG_FLAGS=--no-post-clean — redundant (default in dpkg 1.19+), no effect
#   (2) builddeb `set -eu` hook — anchor found and patched but the hook never
#       fires because builddeb's CWD when it runs is debian/linux-image-X.Y.Z/
#       staging dir, NOT the kernel source root, so the `[ -f Module.symvers ]`
#       test fails silently
#   (3) Pre-build snapshot — bindeb-pkg's internal `make clean` then rebuild
#       generates a NEW ephemeral signing key, leaving any pre-snapshotted
#       key paired with the wrong kernel
#
# v2 approach (this block):
#   PRE-bindeb-pkg (run while .config still exists in-tree):
#     - Pre-generate persistent RSA signing key at ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/ask-persistent-keys/
#     - Override CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY to point at it
#     - Run `make olddefconfig` to resolve the change
